Budget Owner’s Guide
====================

..  _budget-owner-introduction:

As a budget owner, you are responsible for your budget:
=======================================================

* **Do not exceed your budget.** We cannot cover expenses exceeding your budget, so you should make sure to keep track of all expenses.
* **Keep your deadlines:**
    * In your budget application, you committed yourself to milestones. Keep in mind that your budget is bound to these milestones.
    * Bookkeeping closes around 15th December each year, so you should submit all of your invoices before this date.
* **Report on your activities.** Most budgets are bound to a report, so please don't forget to write a report.
* **Ensure that invoices are correct.** Invoices with formal errors may be considered as illegible for refund.
* **Food and beverages at sprints** are allowed to get reimbursed. They do not cover expenses during travel time. The expenses should stay reasonable. Expenses for excessive alcohol consumption can be disallowed, even after the sprint.

Budget types
============

There are two types of budgets:

* **Budgets for teams and infrastructure** is granted by the Board of the Association and supervised by the BCC.
* **Budget Ideas.** They are granted in each quarter after a member poll.

..  _budget-owner-process:

Process
=======

* Budget Idas are discussed by the Budget Committee, publicly by the Community and then rated by the Members via Memberpoll.
* The Board decides about the final budget application and then grants the application fully or partly.
* The Budget owner will receive a formal budget agreement (via mail). The agreement must be confirmed by answering the mail.
* The Budget will be set up in  the `reimbursement tool <http://reimbursement.typo3.com/>`__. **The budget is accepted by the Budget owner automatically, once the first reimbursement is done.**

..  _budget-owner-application:

Budget Application Form
=======================

As a budget owner, you need to hand in a `budget application form <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hPQLeBDT43PjOT5zQ3vdX5xTFE9hqqxhp6VCmBwaRDU/edit#gid=0>`__.  Please send a copy or the link of your application to budget(at)typo3.org

Your budget application can contain three different types of costs:

* **EN: enabling costs** (travel, hotel, infrastructure, food and beverages during sprints; tickets for events, etc)
* **WT: worktime costs** (we prefer funding projects that use a maximum of 50% paid working time)
* **AC: acknowledgements costs** (acknowledgement of effort which is not in direct relation to working hours or items, for example, an amazon voucher. If money is acknowledged, it should not be higher in sum as the same result in working hours)

..  note::
    Please note: The TYPO3 Association wants to foster contribution with our budgets. Applications with less working time will be preferred.

==================
How to Spell TYPO3
==================

..  _spell-t3-rule:

Uppercase, No Space
===================

TYPO3 is always written in uppercase, with no spaces. This rule covers all products under the TYPO3 project. URLs are the only exception to this rule.

A complete product name should have "TYPO3" as the first word, for example "TYPO3 CMS".

The number "3" is a part of the product name. It is not a version number.

Read about the history of the TYPO3 name.

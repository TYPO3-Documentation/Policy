Conflict of Interest Management Policy
======================================

*This policy was voted into effect through a Board vote in October 2023. The Possible Conflict of Interest Mapping matrix was updated 3 April 2025. Migrated to the current repository 19 November 2025.*

Goals of the TYPO3 Conflict of Interest Management Policy
=========================================================

TYPO3's Conflict of Interest Policy aims to ensure that the collective interests of the TYPO3 community prevail over personal interests by exercising our responsibilities and making our decisions impartially, objectively and independently.

Definition of a Conflict of Interest
====================================

The occurrence of a personal interest whose interference with the position held is such as to influence or appear to influence the loyal exercise of the position.

Sensitive Processes, Critical Positions and At-Risk Operations
==============================================================

Only conflicts of interest within the perimeter of the sensitive processes, critical positions and at-risk operations are covered by this conflict of interest management policy.

Sensitive Processes
-------------------

Sensitive processes are processes whose conflict of interest would be harmful to the interests of the TYPO3 community. These processes are: Purchasing, sales, investments, accounting, and human resources management. This list is not exhaustive and will be updated regularly.

Critical Positions
-------------------

Critical positions include: TYPO3 Association Board and BCC members, TYPO3 Company Supervisory Board members, TYPO3 Company CEO, CTO and CFO, TYPO3 CMS product owner, project leader and co-leader. This list is not exhaustive and will be updated regularly.

At-Risk Operations
-------------------

Some operations inherent in the life of the TYPO3 project (prospecting, finding new markets, external growth, lobbying, lending or borrowing money, etc.) are more exposed to the corruption risk. Preventing conflicts of interest that may arise during these operations is likely to reduce the corruption risk.

Different Types of Conflict of Interest
=======================================

There are several types of conflict of interest:

* A **real** conflict of interest is one in which an individual's current official duties and responsibilities directly conflict with his or her existing personal interests.
* A **potential** conflict of interest exists when an individual has personal interests that could potentially conflict with his or her official responsibilities.
* A **perceived** conflict of interest exists when the public may believe that an individual's personal interests could influence the performance of his or her official duties - whether or not this is actually the case.

Code of Conduct
===============

Any individual falling within the scope of the sensitive processes, critical positions and at-risk operations defined above must :

* **Disclose** any conflicts of interest by filling in a declaration of interests before taking up their position;
* **Declare** any conflicts of interest of which they are aware. The nature of the conflict of interest must be recorded in the conflict of interest register.
* **Remove** themselves from any Board discussion on topics involving a conflict of interest. They should do so either in the meeting or with other Board members before or after the Board meetings.
* **Refrain** from attending the meeting during discussion, voting or deliberating on decisions related to the conflict of interest, unless expressly invited to do so by unanimous agreement by all other members present. The Board Member’s abstinence should be recorded in the meeting minutes.
* **Respect** the confidentiality of all person(s) who declare an existing or potential conflict of interest.

Priority Matrix
===============

The priority matrix is used to weight the severity of a conflict of interest by its probability, and to determine whether action needs to be taken to reduce this priority.

**Only conflicts of interest with a value greater than or equal to 4 should be dealt with using one of the strategies described below.**

+-------------------------------+------------+------------+
| Conflict of interest Type     | Low (1)    | High (3)   |
+===============================+============+============+
| Perceived (1)                 | 2          | 4          |
+-------------------------------+------------+------------+
| Potential (2)                 | 3          | 5          |
+-------------------------------+------------+------------+
| Real (3)                      | 4          | 6          |
+-------------------------------+------------+------------+

Resolution Strategies
=====================

* **Record/register:** Recording the disclosure of a conflict of interest in a register is an important first step; however, this does not necessarily resolve the conflict. It may be necessary to assess the situation and determine whether one or more of the following strategies is also required.
* **Restrict:** It may be appropriate to restrict involvement in the matter, for example, refrain from taking part in debate about a specific issue, abstain from voting on decisions, and/ or restrict access to information relating to the conflict of interest. If this situation occurs frequently, and an ongoing conflict of interest is likely, other options may need to be considered.
* **Recruit:** If it is not practical to restrict your involvement, an independent third party may need to be engaged to participate in, oversee, or review the integrity of the decision-making process.
* **Remove:** Removal from involvement in the matter altogether is the best option when ad hoc or recruitment strategies are not feasible, or appropriate.
* **Relinquish:** Relinquishing the personal or private interests may be a valid strategy for ensuring there is no conflict with your public duty. This may be the relinquishment of shares, or membership of a club or association.
* **Resign:** It may be an option if the conflict of interest cannot be resolved in any other way, particularly where conflicting private interests cannot be relinquished.

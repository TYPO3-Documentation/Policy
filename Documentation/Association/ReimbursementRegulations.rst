..  _reimbursement-introduction:

Introduction and Getting-Started Guide
======================================

**If you are new to the reimbursement process, you can read this introduction to learn the basics of how and when to reimburse expenses from the TYPO3 Association. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact the `budget owner <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/budget#c13503>`__ or read the detailed :ref:`Reimbursement Regulations <reimbursement-regulations>`.**

While it is your job to correctly document your expenses and submit them in time, it is each budget owner <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/budget#c13503>`__’s responsibility to answer your questions and give you the information they think you need.

..  _reimbursement-members-money:

It Is the Members’ Money
------------------------

The `TYPO3 Association <https://typo3.org/project/association>`__ is a not-for-profit organization funded by our `members <https://typo3.org/project/association/members>`__. We reimburse expenses and work time as a way to enable our community to do great things for TYPO3. If your expenses can be covered through other means, such as by your employer, we ask that you pursue such possibilities.

..  _reimbursement-budget-owners:

Budgets and Budget Owners
-------------------------

Each year, the `TYPO3 Association <https://typo3.org/project/association>`__’s money is divided into budgets for teams and projects, based on input from the `members <https://typo3.org/project/association/members>`__. Each budget has a single Budget Owner. This is the person to contact if you have questions. It is also the person who accepts (or rejects) your reimbursement requests. `List of budgets and their owners <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/budget#c13503>`__

..  _reimbursement-process:

Reimbursement Process
---------------------

You should start the reimbursement process early, before you have had any expenses or done any work.

..  _reimbursement-process1:

1. Ask the Budget Owner for pre-approval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ask the `budget owner <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/budget#c13503>`__ for pre-approval of your expenses using the `Pre-Approval Form <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/reimbursement-regulations/pre-approval>`__. You do not have to do this if the `budget owner <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/budget#c13503>`__ has issued a general pre-approval for your type of expense, but unless you’re certain of that, submitting the form is the way to go.

A pre-approval means the `budget owner <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/budget#c13503>`__ sees nothing wrong with reimbursing your expenses based on the information you have given. Your reimbursement request will be accepted when the time comes, as long as it does not violate the :ref:`Reimbursement Regulations <reimbursement-regulations>`, e.g. by being contrary to the pre-approval, insufficiently documented, or submitted too late.

..  _reimbursement-process2:

2. Book travel and lodging, do the work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Book travel and lodging, do the work, and incur the expenses pre-approved by the `budget owner <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/budget#c13503>`__. Make sure to keep hold of, photograph, or scan all receipts, invoices, time logs, and other paperwork that documents your expenses or work time. For more information, read :ref:`section 5, Documentation <reimbursement-regulations-5>`.

If you are unable to cover travel, lodging, and food expenses, you can ask the budget owner for advance payment. You can do this by `submitting a reimbursement request <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/invoicing-the-typo3-association/reimbursement-tool/create-a-reimbursement>`__ documenting the expenses you expect to have. See section :ref:`2.n <reimbursement-regulations-2n>` for detailed requirements.

..  _reimbursement-process3:

3. Submit a reimbursement request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Submit a reimbursement request <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/invoicing-the-typo3-association/reimbursement-tool/create-a-reimbursement>`__ using the Reimbursement Tool within 20 days. Check out the `step-by-step guide <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/invoicing-the-typo3-association/reimbursement-tool/create-a-reimbursement>`__. This will send a request asking the `budget owner <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/budget#c13503>`__ to review your request.

The reimbursement is usually paid out by `PayPal <https://www.paypal.com/>`__ or `bank transfer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer>`__ within a couple of weeks. A bit later you will receive an automatic email asking you to confirm that you have received the reimbursement. If the money has not arrived by this point, you should contact the `budget owner <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/budget#c13503>`__.

..  _reimbursement-travel-lodging-food:

Travel, Lodging, and Food
-------------------------

Given the `budget owner <https://typo3.org/project/association/funding-finances/budget#c13503>`__’s approval, the `TYPO3 Association <https://typo3.org/project/association>`__ reimburses **travel and lodging expenses, for real and practical participation in a TYPO3-related activity**. The expenses should cover travel with the best price/time ratio, on the most environmentally friendly means of transportation, in the :ref:`lowest service class <reimbursement-regulations-2c>`, from a person’s home to their destination, and back.

**Flying** distances shorter than 300 km one way is a big “no”. Using your **private car** is allowed at EUR 0.30/km, maximum EUR 220. More private car rules in :ref:`section 2.g <reimbursement-regulations-2g>`.

**Hotel rooms** are reimbursed at maximum EUR 130/night. To save money, some teams do group bookings and share rooms. Don’t book hotel rooms in Düsseldorf, Germany. TYPO3 has special rates there, so contact your budget owner instead. Further details in section :ref:`2.k <reimbursement-regulations-2k>`.

**Food** is only reimbursed if it’s an inclusive hotel breakfast or a reasonably-priced group meal at a sprint. See section :ref:`2.l <reimbursement-regulations-2l>`.

..  _reimbursement-work-time:

Work Time
---------

If you reimburse work time, you have to **keep a log** of hours worked. It has to show the total number of hours worked per day, as well as either individual time entries or summarized time per task per day. You can work a maximum of **6 hours/day** for a maximum of **EUR 55/hour**. See :ref:`section 3 <reimbursement-regulations-3>` for details and this `time log example <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TYPO3-Documentation/Policy/refs/heads/main/Resources/Public/Downloads/ExampleTimelog.pdf>`__.

..  _reimbursement-invoices:

Invoices
--------

If you’re a **business or freelancer, you can invoice** the `TYPO3 Association <https://typo3.org/project/association>`__ and submit the invoice as a part of the reimbursement request. Remember to write the budget number on the invoice. Most invoicing applications will generate **invoices that comply with the minimum requirements** in :ref:`section 4.d <reimbursement-regulations-4d>`. Remember that you’re invoicing a Swiss association, so you should only apply VAT if you are invoicing from Switzerland.

Although you’re invoicing, you still have to include all of the paperwork that documents your expenses or work time. The **invoice must be due at least 20 days** into the future when you submit it. See :ref:`section 4 <reimbursement-regulations-4>` for detailed requirements and this `example invoice <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TYPO3-Documentation/Policy/refs/heads/main/Resources/Public/Downloads/ExampleInvoice.pdf>`__.

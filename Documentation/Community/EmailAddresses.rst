============================
typo3.org — E-Mail Addresses
============================

Since the community is growing, we needed to have a written ruleset on how to use a personal @typo3.org address for communication to the outside. The rules as described below were voted on and accepted unisonous during the board meeting on October 11th 2010.

..  _t3o-email-naming:

Naming ruleset for new personal typo3.org mail addresses
========================================================

Instead of "firstname@typo3.org" or "nickname@typo3.org" new personal addresses will always be built as "firstname.lastname@typo3.org". This will avoid conflicts where multiple persons share the same firstname (sharing the mail address doesn't seem a clever solution).
All existing address owners will get a "firstname.lastname@typo3.org" address, too. Their existing "firstname@typo3.org" or "nickname@typo3.org" address can be used further on, the new "firstname.lastname@typo3.org" will be redirected to the existing one. It's up to the owner, which one is used for communication to the outside.
In the case that a second person with exactly the same name requires an address, a solution must be thought out that fits best for the situation.

..  _t3o-email-revocation:

Revocation of a personal address

If the above rules are not followed by the owner of a personal address, the Board of the TYPO3 Association can revoke the permission on such an address.

Before a personal address can be revoked, the owner has to be warned clearly in written form (CC to board list). If the situation doesn't change within reasonable time, the address can then be deleted.

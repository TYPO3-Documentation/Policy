Decision-Making Processes, Contribution and Participation within the TYPO3 Community
====================================================================================

**This policy outlines the difference between groups, as well describing the decision-making, empowerment and disbanding processes.**

..  _decision-process-types:

Types of Participation
======================

..  _decision-process-team:

Teams
-----

Teams are responsible for a certain part of the community, indefinitely or for a longer period of time.

..  _decision-process-committee:

Committees
----------

Committees are established by the TYPO3 Association Board as defined in the TYPO3 Association’s bylaws.

..  _decision-process-team-leaders:

Team Leader Group
-----------------

Every Team and Committee sends the Leader (or a representative) to the Team Leader Group. The Group is appointed by the Board of the TYPO3 Association and a representative of the Board chairs the group.

..  _decision-process-initiative:

Initiatives
-----------

An initiative consists of people with a common interest to make long-term improvements to a specific area of TYPO3, including strategic plans, goals, and monitoring of progress. An Initiative is instanced by Team, Committee or the TYPO3 Association.

It’s important that initiatives maintain focus on achieving their defined goals. When the goals have been reached, the initiative is dissolved.

Examples of initiatives:

* Migrating all Forge issues to GitHub.
* Migrating content from wiki.typo3.org to docs.typo3.org.

..  _decision-process-community:

Decision-Making Processes Within the TYPO3 Community
====================================================

Decisions should be made within the groups (teams, Committees, Initiatives)  themselves.

Each decision should be aligned with the common roadmap of the TYPO3 project.

If a decision influences the work of several teams, the Team Leader Group should be consulted. This is especially important if new services are being introduced, existing services are being shut down, and for situations concerning the external presentation of the TYPO3 project.

If the Team Leader Group is not able to reach a decision, the Association Board must be brought into the discussion.

Every decision should embrace the TYPO3 values. The benefits of changes should always be determined.

Every decision must be based on factual pros and cons and the intention to improve a situation. (“What is improved by choosing this particular direction?”)

===========================
Rules for Using TYPO3 Slack
===========================

Slack simplifies communication and brings our global community together, creating a virtual shared workspace where conversations are documented and accessible. These rules are a platform-specific addition to general community regulations, such as the Code of Conduct.

You can `learn how to set up a TYPO3 Slack account <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/guide-step-by-step/main/en-us/10GettingStarted/05MeetTheCommunity/SignUpForATypo3SlackAccount.html>`__.

Creating new channels
=====================

..  _slack-rules-new-channels-general:

General
-------

1. Please check is a channel matching your topic already exists.
2. Add a description about your channel, so others can easily identify the purpose of your channel.

Naming conventions
------------------

..  _slack-rules-channel-naming-general:

General conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Use names from more general to more specific, separated by dash (`-`). Example: `#generalcategory-specificcategory`. This way, if someone is in several similar channels, they will be sorted in a way that is helpful for them.
2. Channels about a general topic often begin with `#cig` (e.g. `#cig-performance`)
3. Use well-known terms for things that are already being used. Example: `#t3cs` is used for TYPO3 Camp Stuttgart. That is already being used as hashtag. `#t3ch-hamburg` adds additional clarification and disambiguation.

..  _slack-rules-channel-naming-specific:

Specific conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Channels for specific extensions: `#ext-<extkey>`. Example: `#ext-news`
2. Channels for user groups: `#t3ug<usergroupname>`. Example: `#t3ughof` (User Group Hof), `#t3ugrn` (User Group Rhein-Neckar)
2. Channels for camps: `#t3c<location>`. Example: `#t3ch` (Hamburg) or `#t3ch-hamburg` (is longer, but avoids ambiguity)

..  _slack-rules-closing-channels:

Closing channels
================

The Slack admin team identifies channel with duplicated purposes or with no actions. They will get archived and later deleted.

..  _slack-rules-messaging-threads-topics:

Messaging, threads, and topics
==============================

1. Use threads for one topic: To make discussions more clearly arranged, use the threads options It  isok to create a thread from someone's message.
2. Please respect the privacy of our users and avoid direct messages. Use them only if you are already in touch with someone.
3. Use notification wisely: Please always consider if a notification is really necessary before useing `@user`, `@here`, or `@channel`.
